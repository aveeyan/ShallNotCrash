Example E140: Emergency Detection System Test

This script serves as a practical example of how to use the 'shallnotcrash'
emergency detection module. It simulates a flight scenario with abnormal
telemetry and passes it to the detection pipeline, printing the final diagnosis.

This file is intended to be run as a standalone script from the project root.
