"""
[ULTRA-REALISTIC POLISH - V25]
This version provides the final tuning for "ultra-realistic" path generation.
By significantly increasing the SMOOTHING_FACTOR, the spline algorithm is given
more authority to create a natural, flowing curve that is not rigidly bound to
the coarse waypoints of the A* search. This eliminates the final jagged
artifacts at the entry and exit of turns.
